## Lecture 18 OS Origanization

- Monolithic: big, high level abstraction
  - portable
  - easy for programmer, complicate for kernel
  - resource management
  - easy for data transform
  - all kernel code run at privilege mode
  - big -> complex -> bugs -> security problems
  - hard to optimize
  - low extensibility
- Micro Kernel: 
  - privide IPC between tasks
  - file system, disk driver, netword stack, all in user mode
  - small ->
    - security
    - easy to prove no bugs, verifiable
    - easy to optimize
  - user level code ->
    - encourge moduler, like file server process
    - robust, just restart some service while bug happends
  - challenges
    - how to minimum system call api
    - how to support something like exec() fork()
    - how to make ipc faster
- L4
  - only 7 syscalls
    - thread create
    - send/receive IPC
    - edit other tasks memory mapping
    - access device
    - set what to do while exception happends
